## Project 1: Malaria Detection
### Overview
This project focuses on determining whether a cell is infected with malaria or not, addressing a binary classification problem using deep learning techniques

### Features
- Model implementations: `Basic CNN`, `VGG16`, `EfficientNetB3`, `ResNet50`, `MobileNetV2`
- Code explanations and fine-tuning techniques

### Dataset
- [Cell Images for Detecting Malaria](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria)
